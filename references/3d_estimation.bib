abstract = {A comprehensive survey of computer vision-based human motion capture literature from the past two decades is presented. The focus is on a general overview based on a taxonomy of system functionalities, broken down into four processes: initialization, tracking, pose estimation, and recognition. Each process is discussed and divided into subprocesses and/or categories of methods to provide a reference to describe and compare the more than 130 publications covered by the survey. References are included throughout the paper to exemplify important issues and their relations to the various methods. A number of general assumptions used in this research field are identified and the character of these assumptions indicates that the research field is still in an early stage of development. To evaluate the state of the art, the major application areas are identified and performances are analyzed in light of the methods presented in the survey. Finally, suggestions for future research directions are offered.}

 abstract = {Recovering 3D human pose and body shape from a monocular image is a challenging task in computer vision. In this paper, we present an optimization-based algorithm and an innovative framework to reconstruct 3D human body from a single monocular image. All the evaluation tasks are established on the basis of the classic parametric 3D body model SMPL. Firstly, a new combined objective function of SMPL parameters is proposed to involve four loss terms on 2D joints, 3D joints, facial landmarks and pose priori, respectively, which increase the reliability of the evaluation results dramatically. Furthermore, we use the estimation results given by an end-to-end regression network as the initial values of the parameters, which has been proved to speed up the optimization process. The experiments on benchmark datasets Human 3.6~M, LSP and a wild dataset demonstrate that our model achieves an accurate and robust estimation of the 3D human body and outperforms the popular competing algorithms in precision and robustness.},

In this paper, we tackle the 3D human pose estimation task with end-to-end learning using CNNs. Relative 3D positions between one joint and the other joints are learned via CNNs. The proposed method improves the performance of CNN with two novel ideas. First, we added 2D pose information to estimate a 3D pose from an image by concatenating 2D pose estimation result with the features from an image. Second, we have found that more accurate 3D poses are obtained by combining information on relative positions with respect to multiple joints, instead of just one root joint. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on Human 3.6m dataset.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation involves estimating the articulated 3D joint locations of a human body from an image or video. Due to its widespread applications in a great variety of areas, such as human motion analysis, human–computer interaction, robots, 3D human pose estimation has recently attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community, however, it is a challenging task due to depth ambiguities and the lack of in-the-wild datasets. A large number of approaches, with many based on deep learning, have been developed over the past decade, largely advancing the performance on existing benchmarks. To guide future development, a comprehensive literature review is highly desired in this area. However, existing surveys on 3D human pose estimation mainly focus on traditional methods and a comprehensive review on deep learning based methods remains lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of existing deep learning based works for 3D pose estimation, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and provide an in-depth understanding of this area. Furthermore, we also explore the commonly-used benchmark datasets on which we conduct a comprehensive study for comparison and analysis. Our study sheds light on the state of research development in 3D human pose estimation and provides insights that can facilitate the future design of models and algorithms.},

Even when this film was inverted and run backward, some sort of human movement was still perceived. It was perceived more frequently as an upright image of a person moving forward in a very strange manner than as an inverted image of a person moving backward. Such strangeness seemed to arise from the fact that the actor's arms were perceived as legs and vice versa. The phase relations typical of the Johansson pattern are therefore still present when the film is inverted and run backward, leading to the perception of biological motions though these motions are very strange. }
