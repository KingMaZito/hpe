\section{Introduction}
In computer vision, image data acquisition is divided into the following categories. \emph{passive} or \emph{active} sensing. Passive sensing uses visible light or other electromagnetic wavelengths to acquire position data, while active sensing requires special devices attached to the person's body to obtain parametric data.
